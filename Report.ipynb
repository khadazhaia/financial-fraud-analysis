    "- Out of 6 million transactions less than 1% of transactions are fraud \n",
    "\n",
    "- There are 5 different type of transactions and cash out transactions are used the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only cash out and transfer transactions are fraud and tends to happen at higher transacation amounts. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Fraud transactions remain relatively steady, indicating consistent fraudulent activity over time. Non-fraud transactions experience high variability and a dramatic decrease after step 400. The disparity in counts (fraud in the tens, non-fraud in the tens of thousands) shows that fraud is a relatively small fraction of total transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transfer transactions have the highest median and the widest range, indicating variability in the amounts. Payment and debit transactions generally involve smaller amounts with a few exceptions. Cash in and cash out transactions are more moderate in size but still show a number of large outliers."

    "\n",
